# Cryptography

## About it (Team Member 1)
Cryptography is very important in the daily lives of programmers and normal internet users. It serves as a way to secure data transmitted between the client and the server. Blah blah blah.

## Methods of Encryption (Team Member 2)
There are several ways of cryptography including RSA and SHA. Many comparisons could be made, but overall, RSA proves to be much more secure than SHA, which is why it is widely used in HTTPS securing. As you can see, some of my grammar is bad, the paragraphs are not that long, and I can even type placeholders or random text no problem!
