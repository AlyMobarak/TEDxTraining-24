# Quantum Computers 
Classical computers manipulate ones and zeroes to crunch through operations, but quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Just like classical computers, quantum computers use ones and zeros, but qubits have a third state called “superposition” that allows them to represent a one or a zero at the same time.Instead of analysing a one or a zero sequentially, superposition allows two qubits in superposition to represent four scenarios at the same time.
